# Day 2 – SQL Command Types (DDL, DML, TCL, DCL, DQL)

Today I learned different types of SQL commands and how they are used to manage data inside a database.

---

## 1. DDL (Data Definition Language)

DDL commands are used to create and modify database structure.

**Commands I learned:**

* CREATE → create database or table
* ALTER → change table structure
* DROP → delete table
* TRUNCATE → remove all records from table

## 2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML commands are used to insert and manage data inside tables.

**Commands:**

* INSERT → add new data
* UPDATE → modify data
* DELETE → remove data
* SELECT → display data

## 3. TCL (Transaction Control Language)

TCL commands control transactions in database.

**Commands:**

* BEGIN
* COMMIT
* ROLLBACK
* SAVEPOINT

## 4. DCL (Data Control Language)

DCL commands control user permissions.

**Commands:**

* GRANT
* REVOKE


## 5. DQL (Data Query Language)

DQL is used to retrieve data from database.

**Command:**

* SELECT

## What I understood

SQL commands are divided into categories based on their purpose:

* DDL → structure
* DML → data
* TCL → transaction
* DCL → permission
* DQL → query

Now I can create tables, insert records and retrieve data using SQL.
